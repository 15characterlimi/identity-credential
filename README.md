# Android mDL Reference Applications

This repository contains Android mDL reference applications. Currently a single application
is provided which has both mDL reader and mDL verifier functionality. In the future this will
be split into two separate applications.

These applications are not production quality and are provided only to demonstrate how the
Android Identity Credential APIs will work.

This is not an officially supported Google product.
